He had them off within one day and now just chases them around the house. We have had this for about 3 months . It is also very attractive everyone comments on it . It is in our living room . I have been thinking of buying the larger one too now that I have seen how sturdy it is and just how well made it is in general . Also no carpet debris on the floor like normal scratchers .

Using the provided slotted threaded rod, attach the divider disk and upper part of the post to the lower part of the post (screw the rod into the lower part of the post, put the disk over the rod, and then screw the upper part of the post onto the rod). It takes about as long to read the directions as it does to assemble the unit. Our cats really love it, because they can stretch full length while grasping it. One of our cats likes to climb on top and perch. Since they have been able to use this post, they have done much less damage to the furniture. see less",

The only thing I would change is the brown thin carpeting... it does not seem very rugged, yet it is, in fact, still ok after about 6 months of daily use.  If you bought one and need to replace a bolt, just take it to any big box hardware store and they can tell you exactly what it is, which is probably a metric size bolt.

The depth of the hole should be the same as the length of the bolt, and then lower the expansion screw kit and the white anti tipping strap on the cat climbing frame into the hole. see less",

If children are in the home I would worry about it falling if not anchored to the wall. I would be very afraid to have my cats trying to use this on a daily basis.

As Aline mentioned, we didn't cut the top tube with the spring. Instead, we took 3 inches off the bottom three tubes with a sharp finishing saw that went right through the carpet and cardboard tube. (Used a knife to cut the bottom piece of carpet after the saw went through the tube. The plastic piece used to screw the tubes together was stapled in; just use needle-nose pliers to pull them out and the plastic piece pulls out easily. I glued the plastic pieces into the shortened tubes. In use, however, the fit was so tight it left a glue ring top and bottom, with little glue to attach them, so that glue isn't holding, and two of the pieces have come apart. On a long trip now, but when we get back, I'll go the staple route. Shortened the white PVC tube to around 8 inches. We also fashioned a \"hook\" to hold it steady against the bunk edge, out of a right angle brace and bungee cord. It was very steady until the glue let go, but even with the little bit of wobble, the cats just swarm up it to the bunk level.

I was actually looking for a tree to accommodate the 17 lb guy and another about 13 lbs. The others are a bit smaller. My 13 lb buddy is kind of large in physical, meaning he is tall cause he has very long legs. These 2 play really hard on it fighting/playing. They take running leaps and hit it full force. I'm surprised they haven't broken it cause they did a different one. I do have a cat weighing 22 lbs but he doesn't play on it cause he's pretty old, 17 yrs. He does fit well in the cubby on the bottom which I was hoping he would. The little shelf above the cubby is about 18x13, the shelf above that is about 18x18 and the bed on top is 14x14 with little sides on it. The 2 babies I mentioned sleep together in the bed. The cubbie at the bottom is decent size. It measures 22x22x13 high. I am thinking about screwing the whole thing to a board about 24x24 just to stabilize it. I'm afraid when they hit it full force they could tip it cause its so tall. But it really is a very heavy unit. see less",

She bought new twine from a craft store, then use a hot glue gun to adhere it as she wound it around the post. Not sure how crafty you are, but you could get carpet samples & replace the carpeting either with glue or staples depending on the location. You can usually get carpet samples from home improvement stores (even for free depending on the size) like Home Depot, lowes or a mom & pop shop. If you\u2019re not very crafty or just don\u2019t want/have the time to do it, I\u2019d assume you could hire someone you know or online via an app like Next Door or your local town\u2019s/city\u2019s Facebook page to connect with ppl in your community. Or those task/odd job apps that work kind of like Uber/Lyft/InstaCart business but you pay ppl to do or help you with whatever (i.e. assembling IKEA furniture, painting a wall, hanging shelves, etc\u2026) sorry for the long response, as I don\u2019t want to make assumptions as to what you\u2019re able/unable or even want to do.

The bigger one will also jump onto it from time to time, again it shakes, but he doesn't seem to mind. They are even both on it at times, on the two upper perches.  It can handle their weight and all; it won't fall apart. The only thing is that it can shake a bit. Though it may depend on the cat whether they are ok with it (as both of ours are). To be fair, most cat trees will shake a little with cats jumping up it. Most cat trees are not made of solid metal or bolted to the wall all along its height to prevent this. see less",

All have brackets, the roof ones the trickiest since I had to squeeze some smaller ones into v's... The big ones I got have a curved in middle to strengthen them; the top are literally just an L with holes in them...for your purpose any would help. If there is a wooden beam inside the cardboard you can access, it can be reinforced...if it is cardboard, honestly, I would rather rip those out and replace them-wrap the jute around a wood beam instead of risking a lethal accident.

If you know a friend with woodworking gear and talent, they could cut a circular plug exactly 8\" in diameter (perhaps a minuscule amount more) and place it in the hole and glue it. It would make it sturdier to affix a couple of thin braces in a pretty pattern (Cross? Hexagon oriented at 30 degrees) on the inside of the plug , so that they project a little beyond the plug, that would be screwed into the wall of the hexagon box just outside the hole, then the plug could easily be removed if you change you mind and the screw holes filled and sanded. Fancier would be to cut an 8.5\" plug out of lumber that is 0.25\" thicker than the wall and rout a lip 0.25\" wide for gluing it in place. I think the important aspect would be to select very high quality wood that matches the box in color and sanded finish, or the plug would not look good. ;-( see less",

One is over 11 lbs and loves the top level. The smaller cat loves the lower scoop. She is about 8 lbs. Of the three cat platforms and trees that we own, this one is by far their favorite. We have it stationed by a window and they love sitting or lying on it and looking out. Mind you, our windows are lower than standard ones so they can comfortably sit on the platform and enjoy the outdoor happenings without strain. My wife was skeptical when I first bought this one but has been won over completely. The notch in the top level is not a problem at all either as it gives the cat on the bottom level the opportunity to sit up in the scoop without hitting its head. Great cat investment for us!

The screw that holds the top platform on, screws in from underneath the top platform (that the bed stretches over). So, you must reach into the top level cubby hole to the ceiling to do so. Once the screw is seated, you just turn the platform clock wise to tighten it up, but do not over tighten it. Is this what you have been trying to do? Also do you have the right tool to fit the head of the screw? If I remember correctly, I think it was provided with the product. It is a nice tower. Good luck.  G.B. see less",

Frankly, I was concerned that this was less durable than the carpet, but it would seem that it is more durable -- I'm not finding the loose bits of yarn that I commonly find collecting round the base of the other cat-trees I have. While all cat trees will suffer from the depredations caused by cat-use, this one seems to be quite durable. The \"rope\" covered posts are particularly durable and are a real plus compared to the carpet covered posts I have on the other trees.

Hammock items like the Cat Mod Lounge here should either be installed with each bracket into a stud or installed with toggle anchors for each bracket. Solid items like shelves and Escape Hatches can be installed with one bracket into a stud and the other bracket installed with either drywall anchors or toggle anchors.  If you do use drywall anchors, we don't recommend this as being used for primary support. During our many weight tests, we found that even the most heavy duty drywall anchor was not able to withstand the force of a cat jumping onto the shelving, and eventually, the brackets pulled out of the wall (usually taking some of the wall with it).  Additionally, you can use Toggle Anchors as either primary or supplementary support. I will provide a link to the Toggle Anchors we've weight tested with and have found to be extremely sturdy and fairly easy to install. - https://www.amazon.com/Self-drilling-Toggle-Drywall-Anchors-Screws/dp/B016TYQXGU/ see less",

There is a small black plastic sleeve on the post of the toy. Stick the metal end as far down into the hole as you can. Slide the plastic sleeve around the post into the whole. Use the flat edge of the screwdriver to firmly seat the sleeve into the hole by gently tapping it with your hammer. Do this all the way around the sleeve. You should not be able to see the sleeve once it is properly seated. My kitten is very energetic and he pulled the toy string out of the rubber grommet end on the toy within a few weeks, I recommend that you wrap it with gorilla tape to keep it secure. I have had to do this with all his dangling toys, including feather wands, so I don't attribute it to a defect in the toy, but the fact that my kitten is very rambunctious. see less",

It is however suitable for kittens. Even our smallest cat who is very petite, needed something larger within a year. We no longer have it, but I would estimate only 10\" maybe 12\" square, tops. They are pressed board covered in a thin fabric; not a heavy carpet like you see in pet stores that are very costly. No padding, not even around the inch high frame. But it's easy to recover them. You can add batting, wrap with fabric of your choice and use a stable gun; but kittens grow quickly, so unless money is tight, I would suggest looking for something that has 14-15\". The are out there - you will spend more upfront, but your kittens will grow and still be comfortable. You will notice after looking carefully, that all the pictures on the affordable priced condos only showcase them with kittens. We later bought two with larger surfaces over two years ago.

It occasionally wobbles when they are racing on top of it. But it's never gone too far off the ground. The platforms are big enough for my long kitties. At first I was worried but they fit perfectly and are always on their cat tower. And the boxes are definitely big enough for both of them. I've only bought this cat tree after going online for a few days and doing research. And like you, looking at comments and this mAker has great quality. As long as you continue to keep it clean and vacuum the hair up so it's always clean, this will definitely last. We've hAd it going on three years and it still looks great.

It can provide great stability and help with wobbliness. I guess there is a possibility you could TRY to assemble it with the pipe and NO perches, but as the manufacturer suggests, I would say leaving the perches on is best. see less",

The larger perch has a 12-1/2\" clearance to the next perch but you can rotate the perches to have more or less of the next perch as a roof above it. I did not set mine up like in the picture. I have the small bottom perch just outside the little cubby like a little porch. It's great that the perches can be rotated and set to your own personal preferences. It's 44\" tall with a depth of 25\" but the width depends on how widely you rotate and set the perches. My cat was a little intimidated by it at first. But after a month or two he was bouncing around all over it and using it completely. He loves it now and so do I. This was a terrific buy and I will order from this company again. see less",

The 2nd tier platform is (1'11\") from the floor which has the 2nd house on it and it's top is (2'9\") from the floor. The 3rd tier platform which is above the 2nd house is (3'4\") from the floor. The 4th tier platform is (4'1\") from the floor and the top tier platform as I said earlier is (5'7\") from the floor. I hope this helps you. My cats love the towers and use all the tier's. Just as a side note, I would recommend tightening the tower(s) at least once a month as with lots of use depending on the amount of cats you have the platforms will loosen.
